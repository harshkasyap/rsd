We have eminent speakers from Science, Engineering, Humanities and Social Sciences and Industry sharing their wisdom with the research scholars of the institute. Research is what separates institutes of higher learning from others, and it is really praiseworthy that RSD is considered a flagship event of IIT patna. I am sure the days event along with pre and post workshops/tutorial etc will be very interesting and informative for everybody Wish you all the best. Jai Hind .",
